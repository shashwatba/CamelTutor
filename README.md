🛠️ How It Works
Camel Tutor uses a sophisticated three-step process:

Keyword Generation: When you enter a learning topic, our AI generates 10-15 relevant keywords that are essential for understanding that subject.

Passive Tracking: As you browse the web, the extension quietly scans page content for those keywords, counting how many times you encounter each one.

Active Learning: When you've seen a keyword enough times (default: 5), Camel Tutor generates a personalized quiz to test your understanding and reinforce the concepts.
